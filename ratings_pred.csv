Lets start with Display 😍:: Amoled display with true to life enhancing technology will blow your mind..Dont worry about any pixel burning issues.It has the inbuilt functionality like pixel shift and pixel refresh to optimise the picture quality.
Blue light emission control is a bonus.

Battery:: You will get around around 4 hrs in general 🥲

Performance:: Intel i3 11 gen will handle most of the daytoday task.....

THE GOOD

It's my first smart watch so I can't compare it with others but as my first experience I can say watch didn't disappointed me. It's been 4-5 days I'm using this and the experience of wearing this is good performance in bit lag but work is worth. Features are good for 2.5k watch. The screen quality is good.

THE BAD

8155,8155,Awesome,"It is the best smartwatch. Some of its pros are:
#It worth its cost.
#I like the wallpapers.
#Metallic built give it a premium look.
#Straps are very soft.
There are a few cons:
#Pixel density is less, that's why some wallpapers does not look good.
#Raise to wake is little slow but that's ok.
#It is a little heavy also.
Overall it is the best smartwatch under this price range.",5.0

8307,8307,Must buy!,"Awesome

I bought this watch a week ago. Initial impression and look was fantastic. At first battery drained fast while connecting to mobile app. After that battery standby was excellent. If you are searching for a smart watch with more sports mode and watch looks below 2K, then it will be the best watch for you. Absolutely loved it. My only suggestion for the developers is to add screen lock to this watch.",5.0
8308,8308,Super!,"Loved the product!

8314,8314,Very Good,Touch experience is awesome. Sensors work properly. When you raise your hand & walk then it doesn't count steps properly otherwise everything is nice in it & some times it count automatically(Ghost tracking) when I don't walk just only move my hand.,4.0
8315,8315,Decent product,"THE GOOD AND THE BAD

THE GOOD

It's my first smart watch so I can't compare it with others but as my first experience I can say watch didn't disappointed me. It's been 4-5 days I'm using this and the experience of wearing this is good performance in bit lag but work is worth. Features are good for 2.5k watch. The screen quality is good.

THE BAD

Can't connect in just in single tap have to wait more than 1 min sometimes need to try 2-3 times.
Charging cable wasn't in the box so I had to buy ...

This watch main purpose is for activity tracking, If that doesn't work well, who cares about looks and design.
Forget about returning the pro...

It's my first smart watch so I can't compare it with others but as my first experience I can say watch didn't disappointed me. It's been 4-5 days I'm using this and the experience of wearing this is good performance in bit lag but work is worth. Features are good for 2.5k watch. The screen quality is good.

THE BAD

Can't connect in just in single tap have to wait more than 1 min sometimes need to try 2-3 times.
Charging cable wasn't in the box so I had to buy ...

This watch main purpose is for activity tracking, If that doesn't work well, who cares about looks and design.
Forget about returning the pro...

I have AQFT w15 watch too when I travel from home to office for 15kms it measures step count as max 200. This noise watch measured 2679. Means it’s too sensitive and ...

9687,9687,Fabulous!,"I got this smartwatch during first day of the sale and was delivered within one day so thanks to flipkart. I am quite impressed with the build & design as the watch is very lightweight. Actually, the amoled screen got my attention which is rare to see at this price range and it's absolutely great. UI is also smooth and snappy but don't expect it to be equal with the watches that has ""Wear OS"".

9689,9689,Does the job,"Pros:
* The AMOLED display is hands down the best part of the watch.
* 42mm fits nicely especially if you have small wrists. The strap is comfortable. Decent build quality
*Good touch response & UI

Cons:
*Fair to say that the step counting feature is a joke. Had a OnePlus band before this & that was much more accurate. So, if fitness is important, stay away.
* With Always-on display feature turned on, battery needs to be recharged at the end of the day. 7 day battery life is a pipe dream

9691,9691,Just an average fitness watch,"It's not a smartwatch but a fitness watch which lacks accuracy for most of the health parameters.

1. Display is top notch at this price point. AMOLED display is what differentiates it from others.
2. UI is fluent in transition and there is no stutter.
3. Build quality of watch is good. Watch strap is also of decent make.

9692,9692,Worth the money,Look wise it's ultimate.. Battery backup also good. I liked it's design n display. All the sensors are very accurate also sleep tracking works fine. And also I feel the dial is small.. Only thing is it has less sports mode.. Even if u have 60+ sports mode in other watches.. U won't use all off it. My suggestion is if u want fitness tracker.. Go for fitness bands.. Else if u want for looks and party wear watch u can go for this.. Looks super cool.,4.0

13098,13098,Just an average fitness watch,"It's not a smartwatch but a fitness watch which lacks accuracy for most of the health parameters.
Pros:
1. Display is top notch at this price point. AMOLED display is what differentiates it from others.
2. UI is fluent in transition and there is no stutter.
3. Build quality of watch is good. Watch strap is also of decent make.
4. Noisefit app is a decent application bringing you the entire data at one place.
5. With certain settings in the app, one can get good battery life.
Cons:

13099,13099,Worth the money,Look wise it's ultimate.. Battery backup also good. I liked it's design n display. All the sensors are very accurate also sleep tracking works fine. And also I feel the dial is small.. Only thing is it has less sports mode.. Even if u have 60+ sports mode in other watches.. U won't use all off it. My suggestion is if u want fitness tracker.. Go for fitness bands.. Else if u want for looks and party wear watch u can go for this.. Looks super cool.,4.0

This is a fitness watch. Hence I would expect it to be more better in terms of sensors but to my surprise the steps count sensor is complete disaster.

* The AMOLED display is hands down the best part of the watch.
* 42mm fits nicely especially if you have small wrists. The strap is comfortable. Decent build quality
*Good touch response & UI

Cons:
*Fair to say that the step counting feature is a joke. Had a OnePlus band before this & that was much more accurate. So, if fitness is important, stay away.
* With Always-on display feature turned on, battery needs to be recharged at the end of the day. 7 day battery life is a pipe dream

PROS:
75hz [through hdmi]
5ms response time
IPS panel [beautiful viewing angle ]
AMD free sync
color calibrated
cross hair feature for fps games
black stabilizer
headphone jack
CONS:
The main con is, 60fps videos in youtube will be choppy when you are at 75hz. This is the problem of all 75hz/144hz monitor. Basically you cant divide 75/144 with 60, hence the video will be choppy. turning the refresh rate to 60hz will allow you to watch the video smoothly . ...

16506,16506,Must buy!,"Updated model of Vg240p.

Pros : better refresh rate(144->165hz)
VRB is helpful to reduce motion blur, good colour reproduction, speakers added, Dp cable added.


Cons : plain moniter stand, you can't adjust the height and you will have problem placing moniter close to you due to V shaped stand that might get in way for Mouse/keyboard

I have bought this monitor mostly for gaming purpose which is going good...165hz in valorant real smooth experience tho I'll continue to update as time goes by....and I rated this product 4star because of the late delivery service..if you r looking for great gaming experience you can buy this product no doubt.",4.0
17459,17459,Fabulous!,Great Monitor Overall 🔥! 165 hz really immerse pleasing experience. Great for visual designing and gaming. Would have been better if they had added the vertical tilt.,5.0
17460,17460,Good quality product,"Best value for money monitor with 165Hrz refresh. 100% classic product but HDR is not good. You easily control the monitor with ARTERY software. It 100% G Sync Compatible and it comes with display port which is very good. This Lenovo Model is Nvedia's Certified G-Sync Compatible Monitor so no issues with that.
Excellent Monitor with 165 Hrz Refresh Rate.",4.0
17461,17461,Highly recommended,"Perrrrrrfect monitor. Don't know much about monitors, but what i do is playing 1080p games on it, and watching movies. The screen is good according to me because my eyes used to pain while working on laptop, and my previous TN panel monitor, but it doesn't now while working on it. Stand is quite impressive. You can slide it up and down.
Overall rating 9 out of 10. Not 10 because of it's base which takes a hell lot of space to keep it.",5.0

17463,17463,Terrible product,Too much heating issue even at room temperature. As there is a heating issue in the panel. And it's stand takes 25cm of area on table.And also it doesn't look like 99% sRGB. It's like there is some kind of yellow filter on the screen. Side views are not good also.,1.0

PROS :

1. FULL HD with 75Hz refresh rate!
2. HDMI CABLE in the BOX itself.
3. Easy and peasy installation.

Cons :

1. Stand is shaky.

For this, You can compare and buy this blindly.

And the monitor stand is too weak, if you touch the monitor it will rock for next few seconds – which is super annoying.

20146,20146,Pretty good,"Very important: Dell should change the non-standard plug on the power cord from 16A to 5A.

Workaround: I am using my old monitor's power cable for my sockets. Otherwise, use old PSU cable or buy a 16A to 5A adapter. (A = amperes or amps)


Despite the fact that the monitor supports FreeSync, it's not suitable for gaming as there is ghosting.

If you come from higher resolution + High DPI monitors then you may not want to buy a 27 inch 1080p monitor. You can opt for the 24 inch model.

20171,20171,Terrible product,Too much heating issue even at room temperature. As there is a heating issue in the panel. And it's stand takes 25cm of area on table.And also it doesn't look like 99% sRGB. It's like there is some kind of yellow filter on the screen. Side views are not good also.,1.0
20172,20172,Highly recommended,"I am not a hardcore gamer but this monitor is perfect for me.

This review is after 3 weeks of using this monitor.

It does my job.
So far no issues found.",5.0
20173,20173,Best in the market!,"A really good option if you're looking for a budget gaming monitor. It has display port(which doesn't usually come at this price range) to support Freesync in Nvidia GPUs. Very little to nil backlight bleeding. The IPS glow is evenly distributed. 75hz refresh rate is a good step up but not a great one. The features like black stabilizer and inbuilt crosshair are really useful ones. Eventually, this is the best product you could get at this price range. Go for it without any second thought.",5.0
20174,20174,Terrific purchase,"Hidden gem. It's only my first day, but the screen is beautiful, and huuuge! Text is crisp. Videos play beautifully. It turned out cheaper for me to get this than have my tiny laptop's screen repaired.",5.0

20183,20183,Great product,"Switched from a 60hz TN panel.
Pictures produced by this monitor is very bright with vibrant colours.
Equally suitable for content creation (ips) and gaming (165 hz)
Now I feel less strain in eyes while playing CSGO.
Speakers are not loud but crisp & clear.
Kudos to BenQ and FK for providing this for just 16.7k.
You will not find so much features in this price.
Back light bleeding is increased over time.",5.0
20184,20184,Terrific,"A great display for the price, specially if you are looking for a rotating monitor on a budget.

Only thing that is missing is a ambient light sensor like the one BenQ monitors have to adjust the color temperature of the screen giving even more comfortable viewing experience",5.0

20191,20191,Great monitor with good price.,"Loved the 360 rotation of the monitor, can use at different angles and very sturdy design. I can change the viewing angle without any problem and watch/work comfortably.
Screen size is good, and eye comfort level is also great. no strain on eyes even when I use it for long time while working.
With the good price compared to other brands monitor, it has added feature of adjustable height and higher refresh rate which makes it top of the choice among other brands.

no problems so far.. and it doesn't give eye fatigue like laptop screen( without eye mode on too). just one problem they give 20A three-pin cable with this monitor which is not supported by our Indian household electric bord I had to use 20A to 16A adapter(100Rs) to us...

3. If using USB-C then minimal cabling is required. 60Watt USB PD power brick is provided. Using just two USB cables you can power both laptop and portable display and drive the display as well.
Cons:
1. Slightly expensive",4.0

Why does this monitor goes back to 720p resolution?
And the provided cover cum stand is very flimsy, it wobbles and the screen falls every now and then.
Its hard to find a stand to hold these too as its thicker on the bottom side.
It consumes a lot of power from my laptop and drains the battery very fast.

I’m able to get 144Hz through the HDMI, for which the cable is provided in the box.

Ergonomics are good with height adjustment, tilt and pivot features.
Only thing ...
